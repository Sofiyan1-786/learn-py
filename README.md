# Learn-py
Aim of the project: So in this side project I tried to learn more about python3 while exploring my own fields of intrests (Stock Markets). While Stock exchange api's are paid and slighlty expensive for a student I tried to build a crypto based price monitoring system between 2 exchanges. I learnt more about Arbitrage and python3 hitting 2 birds with one stone.

**Key Discoveries:**
While working on the project, I faced a tough challenge â€“ getting access to stock exchange APIs turned out to be really expensive for someone like me, a student on a budget. To tackle this problem, I came up with a clever idea: I decided to build a system for keeping an eye on cryptocurrency prices. This way, I not only found a way around the money issue but also made a real-world use of Python3 by analyzing financial data in real-time. The part where I focused on arbitrage made the project more complicated and relevant. It showed that I was learning not just about programming but also about how things work in the lively world of crypto trading.


**What I Learned:**
I put it to use in practical ways. Dealing with the money data challenges taught me to find different, money-saving solutions and taught me how important it is to be flexible when you're programming. Getting into the nitty-gritty of crypto market arbitrage deepened my understanding of money strategies and how the market behaves. Overall, this project showed me that when you mix your personal interests with your school studies, you end up learning a lot in a really intresting way.

**What's Next:**
Looking ahead, I want to make my cryptocurrency price watching system even better and fine-tune the fancy strategies I used for arbitrage like including graphs and monitoring multiple currencies including exchange fees etc. The "Learn-py" (Fancy name I gave this project I didnt knew this was available on Github) project is like a starting point for me, a foundation I can keep building on as I keep on learning about Python3 and the exciting world of financial markets.
